# Airbnb Listing Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of Airbnb listings and reviews using a dataset sourced from Airbnb. Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were utilized for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis primarily in Google Colab and DataSpell environments. The aim was to derive meaningful insights from the data to better understand trends and patterns in Airbnb listings and guest reviews.

The dataset provides comprehensive information about Airbnb listings, host details, property characteristics, guest reviews, and booking policies, facilitating analysis of various aspects related to Airbnb accommodation.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Prior to analysis, the dataset underwent extensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps. These included handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and addressing inconsistencies to ensure data integrity and reliability for analysis purposes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover insights from the dataset. Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and exploratory techniques, we investigated relationships between variables, identified trends, and gained insights into factors influencing Airbnb listings and guest experiences.

## Google Colab & DataSpell

Google Colab and DataSpell served as primary environments for conducting data analysis tasks. Utilizing Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we performed data cleaning, visualization, and analysis workflows efficiently. The collaborative nature of these platforms facilitated seamless collaboration and sharing of insights among team members.
